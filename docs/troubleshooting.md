# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for the Copilot Command Ring.

---

## "No serial port detected"

The host bridge can't find your microcontroller.

**Check the USB cable:**

Not all USB cables carry data. Charge-only cables are missing the D+/D− wires. Try a different cable — ideally one you've confirmed works for file transfer.

**Check that the device appears to your OS:**

```powershell
# Windows — Device Manager
devmgmt.msc
# Look under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
```

```bash
# macOS
ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*
```

```bash
# Linux
ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB* 2>/dev/null
```

**Set the port explicitly:**

If auto-detect isn't finding the right device:

```powershell
# Windows
$env:COPILOT_RING_PORT = "COM7"
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export COPILOT_RING_PORT="/dev/ttyACM1"
```

Or create `.copilot-command-ring.local.json`:

```json
{
  "serial_port": "COM7"
}
```

## "pyserial not installed"

The installed host bridge depends on `pyserial`. Reinstall or upgrade
`copilot-command-ring` so pip installs the dependency automatically.

```powershell
# Windows (venv active)
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/spencerbk/copilot-status-ring.git
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux (venv active)
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/spencerbk/copilot-status-ring.git
```

If you're working from a local clone instead of a Git install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** If not using a virtual environment, substitute `py -3 -m pip` (Windows) or `pip3` (macOS/Linux).

## Hooks not firing

The ring doesn't respond when you use Copilot CLI.

**Check that hooks are installed:**

Hooks can be installed globally (works in all repos) or per-repo:

```bash
# Global setup (recommended — one-time, works everywhere)
copilot-command-ring setup

# Or per-repo deploy
copilot-command-ring deploy /path/to/your-repo
```

```powershell
# Global setup (recommended — one-time, works everywhere)
copilot-command-ring setup

# Or per-repo deploy
copilot-command-ring deploy C:\path\to\your-repo
```

Verify hooks exist:

```bash
ls ~/.copilot/hooks/copilot-command-ring.json        # global
ls .github/hooks/copilot-command-ring.json            # per-repo
```

**Check Copilot CLI version:**

Hook support requires a recent version of GitHub Copilot CLI. Update it using the
same installation method you used originally.

**Reinstalled or moved your virtual environment?**

The hook scripts record the path to the Python interpreter that was active when you ran `setup` or `deploy`. If you delete and recreate the venv, or install on a new machine, the recorded path becomes stale. Re-run the hook install command you used:

```bash
# Global hooks
copilot-command-ring setup --force

# Per-repo hooks
copilot-command-ring deploy /path/to/your-repo --force
```

If the hooks can't find any Python runner, they now print a diagnostic to stderr:
`copilot-command-ring: no runner found; rerun setup/deploy`

**Check that wrapper scripts are executable (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
# Global hooks
chmod +x ~/.copilot/hooks/run-hook.sh

# Per-repo hooks
chmod +x .github/hooks/run-hook.sh
```

**Test the hook manually:**

```bash
echo '{"toolName":"bash"}' | copilot-command-ring hook preToolUse
```

If this sends data to the ring (or prints in dry-run mode), the hook itself works — the issue is with Copilot CLI loading it.

## Ring doesn't light up

The firmware may not be running or the wiring may be wrong.

**Check firmware is running:**

- Is the `CIRCUITPY` drive visible? If so, CircuitPython is running.
- Open a serial console (e.g. PuTTY, `screen`, or Mu Editor) to the **console** port and check for errors.
- Press Ctrl+C in the serial console to get a REPL prompt — if you get `>>>`, CircuitPython is running.

**Check wiring:**

- Is the data pin connected through a 330 Ω resistor to the ring's DIN?
- Is the ring getting 5V power?
- Are all GNDs connected together?
- See [hardware.md](hardware.md) for the wiring diagram.

**Check brightness:**

If brightness is set to `0`, the LEDs won't be visible. Check your config:

```bash
echo $COPILOT_RING_BRIGHTNESS
```

Default brightness is `0.04`. Try setting it higher:

```bash
export COPILOT_RING_BRIGHTNESS=0.15
```

## Ring becomes unresponsive after long sessions

If the Pico or other CircuitPython board stops responding and only recovers after a reset, update to the latest `firmware/circuitpython/code.py`.

Recent firmware versions include several safeguards for long-running sessions:

- A capped byte buffer so malformed or partial serial data without a newline cannot grow forever in RAM
- Draining all queued JSON lines each loop so valid traffic cannot backlog indefinitely in memory
- Reading buffered serial data regardless of USB connection state so messages are never lost between rapid hook invocations
- Clearing stale partial input only on USB reconnect (not on momentary disconnects between hook calls)
- Running `gc.collect()` after serial parsing work to reclaim memory from parsed JSON dicts
- Using a watchdog plus firmware reload path so repeated loop failures recover automatically

**If you may be running older firmware:**

1. Copy the latest `firmware/circuitpython/code.py` to the `CIRCUITPY` drive.
2. Reset or power-cycle the board.
3. Re-test with a normal Copilot CLI session.

**If it still happens:**

- Open the CircuitPython console port and look for a `MemoryError` traceback.
- Check that `neopixel.mpy` matches your installed CircuitPython version.
- If you changed the firmware, confirm there are no extra debug prints or large buffers added to `code.py`.

## Animations look wrong

LEDs are lighting up but the patterns are incorrect.

**Check pixel count:**

The firmware is configured for 24 pixels (NeoPixel Ring product 1586). If you're using a different ring size, update the `pixel_count` in your config or firmware.

**Check data pin:**

Make sure the data pin in the firmware matches the pin you've wired. The CircuitPython firmware auto-detects the correct pin for supported boards (e.g. `board.GP6` on Pico, `board.D6` on Feather/XIAO, `board.A0` on QT Py). If auto-detection picks the wrong pin, override it by setting `NEOPIXEL_PIN` at the top of `code.py`. See [`docs/hardware.md`](hardware.md) for the full pin table.

**Check color order:**

Most NeoPixel rings use GRB color order. If colors appear swapped (e.g. red when it should be green), check the color order setting in the firmware.

**Unexpected white flashes while the ring should stay busy:**

The firmware now suppresses `notification` flashes while the winning state is `working`, `subagent_active`, or `compacting`. If you still see white flashes during active work, enable debug logging and inspect which events are being sent:

```bash
export COPILOT_RING_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Look for `notification` payloads in the hook debug output. If the flash is caused by some other state transition, that output will show which event to trace next.

## Permission denied on serial port

**Linux — add to `dialout` group:**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

Then **log out and log back in** (or reboot). Verify:

```bash
groups | grep dialout
```

On Arch Linux, the group may be `uucp`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG uucp $USER
```

**macOS — check Privacy settings:**

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
2. Check **USB** access (macOS 13+) and **Files and Folders** for your terminal app.
3. If using a third-party terminal (iTerm2, Alacritty), it may need explicit permission.

**Windows — driver issues:**

If the device appears in Device Manager with a warning icon:

1. Right-click the device → **Update Driver**.
2. For CircuitPython boards, no special driver is needed on Windows 10+.
3. For Arduino boards, install the Arduino IDE which includes USB drivers.

## Hook causes Copilot errors

The Copilot CLI is misinterpreting hook output.

**Root cause:** The `preToolUse` and `permissionRequest` hooks interpret anything written to **stdout** as a control response (e.g. a permission decision). If the hook accidentally prints to stdout, Copilot CLI may error.

**Fix:** Ensure the hook writes nothing to stdout. All diagnostic output goes to stderr.

**Debug safely:**

```powershell
# Windows
$env:COPILOT_RING_LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export COPILOT_RING_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Debug output goes to **stderr only** and won't interfere with Copilot CLI.

**Check for stray print statements:**

If you've modified the hook code, ensure there are no `print()` calls without `file=sys.stderr`.

---

## Multiple serial devices detected

If your system has multiple serial devices and the wrong one is selected:

**Set the port explicitly:**

```powershell
# Windows
$env:COPILOT_RING_PORT = "COM7"
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export COPILOT_RING_PORT="/dev/ttyACM1"
```

**List available ports:**

```bash
python3 -m serial.tools.list_ports -v
```

This shows all serial ports with their descriptions, which can help you identify the correct one.

**Use a config file:**

```json
{
  "serial_port": "/dev/ttyACM1",
  "device_match": {
    "description_contains": ["CircuitPython"]
  }
}
```

---

## Multiple Copilot CLI sessions

If you run Copilot CLI in multiple terminals (or across different repos) on the same machine, all sessions share the same ring.

**How it works:**

The host bridge tags every serial message with a session identifier (the Copilot CLI process PID). The CircuitPython firmware maintains a lightweight session table and resolves the **highest-priority** state across all active sessions. A system-wide file lock ensures concurrent hook processes never corrupt each other's serial writes.

**Priority order** (highest → lowest):

`error` → `awaiting_permission` → `working` → `subagent_active` → `compacting` → `prompt_submitted` → `session_start` → `agent_idle` → `idle` → `off`

**What to expect:**

- ✅ No crashes, corrupted writes, or silent failures.
- ✅ Each session's events reach the ring intact.
- ✅ The ring displays the most "interesting" state across all active sessions — for example, if one session is working and another is idle, the ring shows the working spinner.
- ✅ When a session ends, the ring seamlessly continues showing the remaining sessions' state instead of going dark.
- ⚠️ The ring cannot display two sessions simultaneously as separate animations — it shows the single highest-priority state.
- ⚠️ If a Copilot CLI crashes without sending `sessionEnd`, the firmware prunes the stale session after 5 minutes. Once all sessions are pruned, the ring shows a dim breathing animation (`agent_idle`) indefinitely — it will not go dark on its own. The ring only turns fully off in response to an explicit `sessionEnd` or a board reset. This means a ring that is breathing when no CLI is running is expected; start a new session to reset state, or power-cycle the board.

**If the ring seems stuck or unresponsive during multi-session use:**

1. Enable debug logging in one session to see what events are being sent:
   ```bash
   export COPILOT_RING_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```
2. Check that the lock is not stale. The lock file is at:
   - **Windows:** `%TEMP%\copilot-command-ring.lock`
   - **macOS / Linux:** `/tmp/copilot-command-ring.lock`

   Deleting this file is safe — a new lock is created on the next write.

3. Verify the session ID is being sent by checking for a `"session"` field in the debug output.

> **Note:** Multi-session arbitration requires the CircuitPython firmware. The Arduino firmware does not parse the `session` field and operates in single-session (last-writer-wins) mode.

---

## Still stuck?

1. **Enable debug logging:** Set `COPILOT_RING_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and check stderr output.
2. **Test the serial connection:** Open a serial monitor (PuTTY, `screen /dev/ttyACM1 115200`, or Arduino Serial Monitor) and manually send a JSON line:
   ```
   {"event":"sessionStart","state":"session_start"}
   ```
   The ring should respond with a white wipe animation.
3. **Run the simulator:** `python3 -m copilot_command_ring.simulate --dry-run` to verify the host bridge logic works independently of hardware.
4. **Check the firmware console:** Connect to the CircuitPython REPL console port and look for error tracebacks.
